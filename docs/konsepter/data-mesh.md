# Data Mesh


Datamesh is a novel paradigm proposed by Zhamak Dehghani from ThoughWorks. 
The paradigm is founded in four principles: domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture, 
data as a product, self-serve data infrastructure as a platform, and federated computational governance.

### Domain-oriented ownership

Decentralize the ownership of sharing analytical data to business domains
who are closest to the data — either are the source of the data or its main
consumers. Decompose the data artefacts (data, code, metadata, policies) -
logically - based on the business domain they represent and manage their life
cycle independently. 

### Data as a Product
Business domains become accountable to share their data as
a product served to data users – data analysts and data scientists.

Data as a product introduces a new unit of logical architecture called, data
product, controlling and encapsulating all the structural components
— data, code, policy and infrastructure dependencies — needed to
share data as a product autonomously.

### Federated Computational Governance

A data governance operational model that is based on a federated decision
making and accountability structure, with a team made up of domains, data
platform, and subject matter experts — legal, compliance, security, etc. It cre‐
ates an incentive and accountability structure that balances the autonomy
and agility of domains, while respecting the global conformance, interopera‐
bility and security of the mesh. The governance model heavily relies on codi‐
fying and automated execution of policies at a fine-grained level, for each
and every data product.

### Self-serve Data Platform

A new generation of self-serve data platform to empower domain-oriented
teams to manage the end-to-end life cycle of their data products, to manage a
reliable mesh of interconnected data products and share the mesh’s emergent
knowledge graph and lineage, and to streamline the exp
